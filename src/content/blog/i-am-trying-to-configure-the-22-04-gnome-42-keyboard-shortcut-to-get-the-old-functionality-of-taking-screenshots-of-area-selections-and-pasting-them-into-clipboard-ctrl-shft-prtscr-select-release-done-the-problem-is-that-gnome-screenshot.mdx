description: "I am trying to configure the 22.04 (Gnome 42) keyboard shortcut to
  get the \"old\" functionality of taking screenshots of area selections and
  pasting them into clipboard (Ctrl + Shft + PrtScr + select/release: done). The
  problem is that $ gnome-screenshot -ac doesn't copy the selection into
  clipboard unless there is an instance of gnome-screenshot utility running.
  Does anyone know how to work around this issue? (I know it is possible to run
  the \"new\" interactive screenshot tool, but that takes too many clicks and is
  not what I want.)"
